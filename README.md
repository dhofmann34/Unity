# Agree to Disagree: Robust Anomaly Detection with Noisy Labels
This repository contains the code for our paper *[Agree to Disagree: Robust Anomaly Detection with Noisy Labels](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3709657)* which was accepted at SIGMOD 2025.

## Unity Overview
Unity converts the unsupervised anomaly detection problem into a learning-from-noisy-labels problem. Given a dataset X and initial pseudo labels containing label noise (Å¶), Unity elegantly combines clean sample selection and label refurbishment to iteratively curate a diverse set of clean samples for training. The figure below overviews each component of Unity.

## Running Unity
The code in this repository was developed using Python 3.9.12 and was ran on an A100 GPU. [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt) contains a list of all the required packages and versions. To run our code, run [main.py](./main.py) which takes in a variety of command line arguments to run different methods, datasets, experiments, and modify various parameters. The different arguments and their allowed values are shown below.
